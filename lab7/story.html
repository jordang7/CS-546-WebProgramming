        <h2>A Very Stressful Night</h2>
        <p>
          I'm doing homework a class where I needed a linux console and I was
          making good progress. I was almost done but still had some work to go.
          It was a long assignment.I got a glass of water and went to put it
          down, but I put it down on an unlevel surface, and proceeded to spill
          an entire cup of water on my laptop. So not only did I just break my
          thousand dollar laptop, but I also lost all my progress on the
          homework and had no way to continue working on it haha. I ended up
          getting borrowing one of my friends laptops and finishing it but it
          was stressful.
