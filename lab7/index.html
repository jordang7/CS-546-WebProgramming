        <h2>Enjoy my elevator pitch.</h2>
        <p>
          I am a 4th year computer science major at the Stevens Institute of
          Technology. I am currently involved in a couple ongoing projects in
          school,highly focused on growing my web development skills. Iâ€™m taking
          a web development elective where I, along with 3 other teammates, are
          building a Movie forum using a MEAN stack(mongo express angular and
          node). And I am also contributing to a brand new website for clients
          of a startup called RelaxTeams with Node js and Firebase for Senior
          Design. Previously I was at a startup called Litt Mobile. Litt is a
          social and events app that focuses on local curated event hosting and
          personal profiles. I worked within an agile team, focusing on both the
          front and back end of their Django web application, as well as some
          experience working with their React native mobile application.
